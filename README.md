A VSCode extension which adds useful functions to the touch bar, including:

- Improved tab navigation (based on position rather than last opened)
- Simplified interface for running code
- Source control (run sync, start checkout, merge, manage stashes, etc.)
- Code editing (jump to definition, rename, quick fix, etc.)
- **Support for WPILib functions (build, deploy, simulate, etc.)**
